# Retail Promo Automation â€“ MVP Product & Tech Spec

## 0) Oneâ€‘liner
A multiâ€‘tenant SaaS for small retailers to autoâ€‘create 5 branded promo images per month, autoâ€‘generate a simple website from templates, and publish posts to Instagram & Facebook via connected accounts â€” all for â‚¹600/month per customer.

---

## 1) Core Value & Scope (MVP)
- **Plan**: â‚¹600/month/customer.
- **Deliverables per customer**:
  - Up to **5 AIâ€‘assisted promo images** per billing month (carryover disabled in MVP).
  - **One basic website** (single domain or subdomain), selectable from template gallery; autoâ€‘filled from onboarding form + uploaded photos.
  - **Social publishing** to Facebook Page & Instagram Business (image + caption + hashtags + scheduled time).
  - **Basic analytics**: posts count, reach/likes/comments (high level), website visits (basic pageview counter).

---

## 2) User Roles
- **Tenant Owner (customer)**: manage brand profile, upload assets, generate images, create website, connect social accounts, schedule posts, view analytics, manage billing.
- **Staff (optional)**: restricted to content tasks (no billing). Can upload assets, propose/generate images, draft posts, edit site sections, but cannot publish without approval if approvals are enabled.
- **Super Admin (your team)**: global access across all tenants; manage templates, limits/quotas, billing, support, incident actions.
- **Managed Operator (your team, perâ€‘tenant)** *(new)*: when you run a customerâ€™s account as a service, this role can fully act on behalf of that tenant (create/edit/publish posts, generate images, update site) but **cannot** see global admin pages. 
- **Client Approver** *(optional)*: can review/approve content and publishing, but cannot change billing or quotas.

## 2A) Operation Modes (Business Models)
- **Selfâ€‘Serve SaaS**: You sell the app. Customers (Tenant Owners) operate their own workspace. Your team is Super Admin only. Support is reactive.
- **Managed Service (Agency Mode)**: You maintain customers through your app. Assign a **Managed Operator** to each tenant. Operators can prepare assets, generate images, schedule/publish posts, and update website on behalf of the client. Optionally require **Client Approver** signâ€‘off before publishing (perâ€‘tenant setting: `require_approval_for_publishing`).

### Approval Workflow (optional toggle)
1. Staff/Operator creates content â†’ status `draft`.
2. Approver (Client Approver or Tenant Owner) reviews â†’ `approved`.
3. Operator (or system) publishes/schedules â†’ `queued` â†’ `posted`.
4. All actions logged in `audit_logs` with actor + timestamp.
